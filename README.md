# Banana Classification
> A machine learning project that classifies different types of bananas based on images using deep learning techniques. The objective is to help farmers and suppliers identify banana varieties effectively.
> 
## Built With

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, Flask
- **Technologies**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Docker

## Live Demo 

A live demo of the banana classification model is currently in progress. Stay tuned for updates! :smile:
